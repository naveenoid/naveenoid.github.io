abstract: |
  We present a highly compliant dense geometry tactile sensor for robot manipulation. The sensor consists of an air-filled membrane with an internal depth camera that captures the membrane's deformation during contact. This design provides both passive compliance for robust grasping and rich tactile information including contact geometry and shear forces. We demonstrate applications in grasp stability assessment, slip detection, and reactive manipulation.

### The Insight

Compliance isn't just for safety—it's an **information source**.

When you grasp an object with a soft membrane, the deformation pattern encodes:
- Contact geometry (where and how much)
- Normal forces (how hard)
- Shear forces (slip prediction)

### Design

- Air-filled silicone membrane
- Internal PicoFlexx depth camera
- 30Hz dense geometry sensing
- Inherent compliance for robust grasping

### Key Results

- Shear force visualization through membrane deformation
- Slip detection before object drops
- Grasp stability prediction from contact geometry

### Legacy

SoftBubble established the design philosophy continued in Punyo (whole-body tactile) and PolyTouch (multi-modal finger). The core insight—soft sensors as both actuators and information sources—remains central to my research.
