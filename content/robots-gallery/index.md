# Robots I've Worked With

From humanoids to microrobots, from firefighting machines to household helpers—this gallery traces my path through robotics research.

## 🇺🇸 Toyota Research Institute (2016-Present)

### TRI Bimanual Manipulation Fleet
*Large Behavior Models research platform*

20+ synchronized bimanual stations for fleet-scale robot learning. Franka Panda arms with custom tactile grippers.

## 🇮🇳 Anna University & NIT Trichy (2001-2005)

### Firefighting Robot
*Undergraduate competition robot*

Award-winning autonomous firefighting robot. Where it all began.

## The Through Line

From undergraduate firefighting robots to TRI's manipulation fleet, the common thread is **making robots that work in the real world**. Each platform taught me something:

- **Humanoids** → whole-body dynamics, balance
- **Soft robots** → compliance as information, morphological computation
- **Tactile sensors** → contact as the missing modality
- **Foundation models** → scaling through data

The journey continues. 🤖
