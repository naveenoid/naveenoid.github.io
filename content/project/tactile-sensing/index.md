## Former Tactile Perception & Control Lead

I led TRI's tactile sensing research from 2017-2023, developing three generations of sensors that bridge the gap between soft robotics and learned manipulation.

### SoftBubble Grippers (2019-2020)

**The Innovation:** Air-filled compliant membrane + internal depth camera = dense geometry sensing with inherent compliance.

- High-resolution contact patch estimation at 30Hz
- Shear force visualization through membrane deformation
- **IEEE RA-L Best Paper Award 2020**

The key insight: compliance isn't just for safety—it's an information source. The membrane's deformation encodes forces that rigid sensors miss.

### Punyo (2022-2023)

**The Innovation:** Whole-body tactile sensing for humanoid manipulation.

- Scalable bubble-based sensing across torso and arms
- Enables full-body contact strategies (hugging, bracing)
- Foundation for contact-rich humanoid policies

### PolyTouch (2024-2025)

**The Innovation:** Multi-modal finger combining tactile imaging, acoustic sensing, and peripheral vision.

- 20× durability improvement via VHB tape-based elastomer
- Contact microphone captures high-frequency interaction signals
- **ICRA 2025 Best Paper Award**

This sensor embodies my thesis: multimodal contact sensing is essential for scaling manipulation.
