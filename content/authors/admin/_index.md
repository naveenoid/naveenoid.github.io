## About Me

> *"If we are machines, then we are machines made up of machines made up of machines all the way down... it's machines all the way down."*
> — Rodney Brooks

I'm a Senior Research Scientist in the **Large Behavior Models** division at Toyota Research Institute, where I work on scaling robot foundation models for dexterous manipulation.

### The Missing Ingredient

My research thesis: **Haptic feedback is the missing ingredient for contact-rich manipulation.** Vision-only foundation models plateau on tasks requiring force control, material discrimination, or handling occlusion—exactly where touch excels.

At TRI, I've led two parallel efforts:
- **Robot Data Lead** for LBM 1.0 — fleet-scale data collection and policy evaluation
- **Former Tactile Perception & Control Lead** — building award-winning sensors (SoftBubble, Punyo, PolyTouch)

This dual perspective—from sensor hardware to data pipelines—shapes my current focus on **haptic-informed foundation models** that integrate vision, touch, and audio.

### Philosophy

I believe in building robots that are "good enough" for real homes—not just lab demos. This means:
- Holistic development across perception, control, and hardware
- Embracing the messiness of domestic environments
- Learning from natural sciences, not just engineering

I work under [Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) and collaborate with faculty at MIT and Stanford.
